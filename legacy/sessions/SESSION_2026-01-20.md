# Session Summary — 2026-01-20

## Work completed
- Triggered deploy via GitHub CLI and investigated SSM wait timeout.
- Identified long Docker build as the cause of SSM wait failure.
- Updated deploy workflow to stream SSM output to CloudWatch, extend timeout, and poll status instead of using the waiter.
- Pushed deploy workflow update to editorbot-stack.
- Cleared stuck SSM commands and confirmed a successful deploy run.

## Notes
- Current deploy flow is still instance-build-based; CI+ECR remains an optional improvement.
